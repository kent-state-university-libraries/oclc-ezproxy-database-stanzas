## Some of OCLC's notes for this stanza

November 2016: The JAMA Network has simplified its URL patterns in a platform redesign. After updating any Starting Point URLs referencing legacy subdomains (e.g. archderm.jamanetwork.com), you may remove those lines from your existing stanza. Redirects are in place from such URLs to the new platform.

Additional information about JAMA URL patterns is available at the JAMA Network.

A Hosted EZproxy Include File is available for this resource. Hosted EZproxy customers will receive automatic updates with OCLC&rsquo;s latest version of this stanza. Note: Hosted EZproxy customers in the Americas using self-service may reference the Include File by adding the following line to config.txt:
