This stanza was provided by the publisher and has not been tested by OCLC. If it&rsquo;s not working properly, please contact OCLC Support.

While this stanza does provide functionality to the majority of the site, the search function is not compatible with EZproxy due to its dependency on Google search functionality.  We do not recommend that libraries proxy publicly available resources, including embedded Google functionality, as this may negatively impact other proxied resources.OCLC Support.
