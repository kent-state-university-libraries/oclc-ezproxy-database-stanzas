## Some of OCLC's notes for this stanza

The stanzas on this page are intended for new Ebook Central customers only. If you are migrating to Ebook Central from EBL or ebrary, please see the EBL stanza page.

Ebook Central has two options for remote access - Single-Sign-On or Patron Login + EZproxy. Please confirm which method you are using with ProQuest Support, and add the database stanza that corresponds with your method.

Single-Sign-On: This option will allow users to access Ebook Central and their personal libraries by signing in to EZproxy. They will not have to sign in to a separate account on Ebook Central to access their saved items and bookshelves.

Patron Login + EZproxy: This option uses EZproxy to allow patrons to access Ebook Central and requires them to sign in with a separate Ebook Central username and password to access their personal bookshelves.

Either remote access method requires EZproxy 6.2.2.
