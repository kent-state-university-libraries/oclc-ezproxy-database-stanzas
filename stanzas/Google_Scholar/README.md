## Some of OCLC's notes for this stanza

A Hosted EZproxy Include File is available for this resource. Hosted EZproxy customers will receive automatic updates with OCLC&rsquo;s latest version of this stanza. Note: Hosted EZproxy customers in the Americas using self-service may reference the Include File by adding the following line to config.txt:

At this time, no Domain line is required. The use of DomainJavascript (DJ) or HostJavascript (HJ) lines is not recommended for this database.

In October 2007, Google started redirecting international domains from scholar.google.com to the localized version. It is not necessary to include all of the international variation, but rather just the one that is appropriate for your country. If other international sites notice a similar redirection to their own country's version, please please report this to support@oclc.org so this page can be further updated.
