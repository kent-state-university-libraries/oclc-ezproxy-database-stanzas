## Some of OCLC's notes for this stanza

The DOI (Digital Object Identifier) System is used when mapping a DOI name (e.g., 10.1000/182) into a DOI link (e.g., http://dx.doi.org/10.1000/186) which is mapped through the DOI System to the content it represents (e.g., a particular journal, volume, article). A variety of database vendors use DOI links to provide links to content that may be contained in other databases hosted by any number of database vendors.
