## Some of OCLC's notes for this stanza

Note: This resource was formerly titled Global Market Information Database (GMID).

A Hosted EZproxy Include File is available for this resource. Hosted EZproxy customers will receive automatic updates with OCLC&rsquo;s latest version of this stanza.

While this stanza does provide functionality to the majority of the site, the search function is not compatible with EZproxy due to its dependency on Google search functionality.  We do not recommend that libraries proxy publicly available resources, including embedded Google functionality, as this may negatively impact other proxied resources.
